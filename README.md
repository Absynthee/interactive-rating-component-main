## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge was quite difficult and provoked me to learn more about how Javascript works and include various functions. The hardest part was getting the correct number to display properly on the thank you section. 

A couple of things I did differently from the brief - I slightly changed the colours to better match the design screenshot, as they were a bit off. I added the radial gradient on the ratings-container, although it's not perfect it does get quite close to matching the original. I also put a button on the second part of the page to let users go back and start again. This was helpful for testing and allowed me to expand my learning a bit more.
